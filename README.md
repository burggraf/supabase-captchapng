## The function `supabase_captchapng` is created in [supabase_captchapng.sql](./supabase_captchapng.sql)

`supabase_captchapng(digits integer default 4, width integer default 80,height integer default 30)`

Output:

Output is a JSON object with 2 properties:
- num: the random number that was generated
- img: a base64-encoded string that can be used in an `img` tag to display the captcha
  - i.e. `<img src="data:image/png;base64, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=="/>`
